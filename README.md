# Install
Make sure `pipenv` is installed: `pip install pipenv`
With `pipenv` dependencies are installed in a virtualized way:
  - First, use `pipenv shell` to enter the environment
  - Second, use `pipenv install` to install dependencies

Alternatively, install dependencies to the system: `pipenv install --system`
